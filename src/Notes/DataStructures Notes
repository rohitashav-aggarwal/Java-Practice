Circularly Linked List: viewed as having a cyclic order, with well-defined neighboring
relationships, but no fixed beginning or end. In order to support
the responsiveness of an arbitrary number of concurrent processes, most operating
systems allow processes to effectively share use of the CPUs, using some form of
an algorithm known as round-robin scheduling.
